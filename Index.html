<section style="font-size:20px; background-color:Orange;">
<p>Overwatch 2 is a free to play game on blizzard with up to 35 heros in which have many different roles containing: <ul>
<br>
<li>Tank who has a lot of hp</li>
<br>
<li>Damage who does a lot of damage</li>
<br>
<li>Healer who heals teamates</li> </ul>
<br>
<br>
Overwatch 2 as a sequel and replacement to the 2016 hero shooter Overwatch, the game intends a shared environment for PvP modes while initially having plans for introducing persistent cooperative modes, though the plans were later scrapped in 2023, focusing the game on its PvP elements. A major change in PvP modes was to reduce team sizes from six to five. Several major characters were also reworked. Overwatch 2 is free-to-play on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S in early access on October 4 and features full cross-platform play.</p>
